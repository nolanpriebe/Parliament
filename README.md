Welcome to Parliment, an open-source framework for building AI swarms that enable autonomous agents to collaborate and achieve complex goals. Parliment leverages the power of Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, and Python to create a scalable and flexible environment for AI agents to communicate, delegate tasks, and make decisions based on their roles and responsibilities.

## Introduction

Parliment is an AI swarm framework that allows you to create a network of autonomous agents that work together to achieve specific goals. It provides a structured approach to agent communication, task delegation, and decision-making, enabling you to build complex AI systems that can adapt and collaborate in real-time.

With Parliment, you can define departments, roles, and responsibilities for your AI agents, and let them interact and make decisions based on their assigned tasks and the messages they receive. The framework is designed to be highly scalable and can be easily deployed on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Features

- Autonomous agent collaboration within an AI swarm
- Structured communication using RabbitMQ message queues
- Role-based agent hierarchy with department heads and members
- Flexible task delegation and goal-oriented decision-making
- Scalable architecture using Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Extensible and customizable agent templates
- Easy integration with external AI APIs and services
- Open-source and MIT licensed

## Architecture

Parliment follows a microservices architecture, where each AI agent runs as a separate container within a Kubernetes cluster. The agents communicate with each other using RabbitMQ message queues, allowing for asynchronous and scalable communication.

The architecture consists of the following components:

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: The underlying infrastructure that hosts the AI agents and manages the container lifecycle.
- **RabbitMQ**: The message broker that facilitates communication between agents using message queues.
- **Department Heads**: The top-level agents responsible for managing their respective departments and delegating tasks to department members.
- **Department Members**: The subordinate agents that work on tasks assigned by the department heads and report back with results.
- **Message Queues**: The communication channels used by agents to send and receive messages, including the cabinet queue, department head queue, and department-specific queues.
